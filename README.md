# Make-Money-with-ML

This Project contains all the code files that I have written for the course titled: Make Money with Machine Learning taught by Siraj Raval.

Most of the files are written using Python. The Python IDEs used are Jupyter Notebooks (Python 3) and Python script written using a text editor (Sublime Text), run using the command prompt. A few files would be in HTML, CSS, Javascript as well.


Unfortunately, the course website got taken down before I could finish the Prelude tutorials. The content is available on Siraj Raval's YouTube Channel though.
